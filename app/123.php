                                    We occasionally offer products that have been irradiated as well always offering
                                    products that have not. Some of our products have been treated by gamma irradiation
                                    in
                                    order to be suited for our immunosuppressed patients. Gamma irradiation is safe and
                                    is
                                    widely used for sterilization of prescription pharmaceuticals, food, and medical
                                    supplies. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes irradiation as a safe way
                                    of
                                    reducing levels of organisms that cause food borne illnesses. Furthermore, health

                                    ranging from spices to grain to chicken to fruits and vegetables. The irradiation
                                    process is performed in an ISO certified sterilization facility licensed by Health
                                    Canada, and in full compliance with the relevant Health Canada and US FDA

                                    We have adopted an easy-to-use equivalence factor of 5 to 1. Quite simply, this
                                    means
                                    that each 50 ml bottle of MedReleaf cannabis oil counts as 10 grams of your monthly
                                    allowance as prescribed by your physician.

                                    Each bottle of MedReleaf cannabis oil comes with its own dropper marked with dose
                                    amounts in milliliters (ml) integrated right into the cap of the bottle. Squeeze the
                                    measured amount under your tongue and let the oil rest there for 30-60 seconds
                                    before
                                    swallowing. The longer you hold the oil under your tongue, the better.

                                    When first trying MedReleaf THC rich cannabis oil we highly recommend starting with
                                    a
                                    dose no greater than 0.25 ml. This 0.25 ml will deliver between 6 – 7 mg of THC. Be
                                    sure
                                    to increase dose amounts in very small increments.<br/>

                                        It will likely take 45 – 90 minutes before you begin to feel the effects

                                    Health Canada has mandated a maximum concentration of 3% weight/volume, or 30mg
                                    THC/mL
                                    of oil, which is why a carrier oil is required.<br/><br/>

                                    A unique version of Sunflower oil has been carefully chosen at MedReleaf as the
                                    carrier
                                    base for our cannabis oils for three reasons:<br/>

                                        Our sunflower oil is essentially tasteless, and therefore does not mask or
                                        modify
                                        the natural taste of our pure extracts

                                        Our sunflower oil is rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats

                                    No. Unfortunately the unique formulation is meant only for oral ingestion. Do not
                                    try to
                                    use it in a vape-pen or vaporizer.
